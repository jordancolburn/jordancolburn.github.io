<meta name="description" content="When it comes to multimedia creation, the technology involved is always getting more impressive as time goes on. &nbsp;As technology gets better and better, there is always a question of how much skill and artistic ability is involved. &nbsp;When electronic music was first coming into the forefront, people questioned whether synthesizers, drum machines and sampling would put &quot;real&quot; musicians out of work. These fears were obviously unfounded and new technology led to more creative uses, but there is a grain of truth that as technology gets better, it does become easier for your &quot;average&quot; hobbyist to achieve results closer to professionals with less money and time investment. I got to thinking about these questions after recently purchasing a Canon T3i DSLR. &nbsp;Just by purchasing a new piece of equipment, my photographs&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;went from&nbsp;amateur hour to a large increase quality. &nbsp;Since I&#39;m mainly an audio recording guy, I tend to approach art from that point of view. &nbsp;I know buying a &nbsp;great new microphone/interface/monitor system/software/etc will result an improvement in quality, but it is not nearly as drastic of an impact as the camera had. &nbsp;The main limiting factor in my audio recording is and will continue to be my mixing, arranging and tracking ability. This doesn&#39;t appear to be the case in photography. &nbsp;An improvement in equipment equaled a big improvement in quality. &nbsp; My theory (and feel free to disagree in the comments) is that arts such as photography are more equipment dependent because you are capturing a real scene. &nbsp;Sure, you have some control by changing angles, zoom, layout of objects and lighting, but essentially you are capturing a moment in time. &nbsp;The better your equipment, the better your ability to capture that moment. When it comes to Audio and Video, you are typically recreating a performance or scene that didn&#39;t actually happen. &nbsp;This composition of a simulated real event (using tools such as reverb, multiple takes, color correction, etc.) requires more experience and skill to pull off correctly. &nbsp; Now this isn&#39;t to downplay skill in photography as there is still an immeasurable amount for me to learn. &nbsp;But if you don&#39;t have the ability to piece together a decent audio recording using an sm57 and any multitrack recorder, you probably need to take a look at your own abilities before upgrading equipment will do much for you. &nbsp;On the other hand, there is a lot to be learned about basic composition by using a point and shoot camera, but by stepping up to a DSLR, you will see an immediate improvement. I&#39;m not exactly sure what point I&#39;m trying to make, but getting a nicer camera has had a big impact on the way I view art and creation (expect many more posts to come with pictures and video grossly abusing depth of field to make me feel artsy). &nbsp;Let me know if you agree or disagree with some of the points in the comments." />

<p>I got to thinking about these questions after recently purchasing a Canon T3i DSLR. &nbsp;Just by purchasing a new piece of equipment, my photographs&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;went from&nbsp;amateur hour to a large increase quality. &nbsp;Since I'm mainly an audio recording guy, I tend to approach art from that point of view. &nbsp;I know buying a &nbsp;great new microphone/interface/monitor system/software/etc will result an improvement in quality, but it is not nearly as drastic of an impact as the camera had. &nbsp;The main limiting factor in my audio recording is and will continue to be my mixing, arranging and tracking ability. This doesn't appear to be the case in photography. &nbsp;An improvement in equipment equaled a big improvement in quality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My theory (and feel free to disagree in the comments) is that arts such as photography are more equipment dependent because you are capturing a real scene. &nbsp;Sure, you have some control by changing angles, zoom, layout of objects and lighting, but essentially you are capturing a moment in time. &nbsp;The better your equipment, the better your ability to capture that moment. When it comes to Audio and Video, you are typically recreating a performance or scene that didn't actually happen. &nbsp;This composition of a simulated real event (using tools such as reverb, multiple takes, color correction, etc.) requires more experience and skill to pull off correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this isn't to downplay skill in photography as there is still an immeasurable amount for me to learn. &nbsp;But if you don't have the ability to piece together a decent audio recording using an sm57 and any multitrack recorder, you probably need to take a look at your own abilities before upgrading equipment will do much for you. &nbsp;On the other hand, there is a lot to be learned about basic composition by using a point and shoot camera, but by stepping up to a DSLR, you will see an immediate improvement.
