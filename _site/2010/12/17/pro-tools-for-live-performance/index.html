<meta name="description" content="The new version of Avid&#39;s (I still always say Digidesign and have to correct myself) Pro Tools, Pro Tools 9, just came out. &nbsp;I just bought and downloaded my upgrade version. &nbsp;There are a lot of new improvements that I&#39;ve been wanting to try out, specifically OMF import and some of the enhanced video features. &nbsp;However, my first chance &nbsp;to use it was a little unconventional compared to how I typically use pro tools. In the worship band at my church, I usually end up playing a Yamaha grand piano with a Korg triton on top. &nbsp;I use a lot of pads, strings, organ mixed with the piano sounds. &nbsp;For a recent night worship &nbsp;service with a different stage setup, we ended up moving the piano offstage. &nbsp;The piano patches on my triton or any of the other keyboards we have around are pretty bad. &nbsp;The best sounding piano I have is the one from Avid&#39;s Mini Grand RTAS plugin that comes with PT. &nbsp;So I decided to find a way to use PT to run some virtual instrument sounds live. After some trial and error, The easiest way I discovered was to create a separate midi track for each sound you plan on using, then create an audio track with the instances of the virtual instruments. &nbsp; You can control which input MIDI interface and channel belongs to each MIDI track and which virtual instrument the sound is routed to in the I/O section. &nbsp;After doing this, arm all MIDI tracks while holding shift to select them all. &nbsp;Then just assign some MIDI CC controls for volume, cutoff frequency, leslie speed, ect. by using the MIDI learn function(right click). &nbsp;After this you should be ready to play, and changing MIDI channels on your controller keyboards lets you change sounds. A nice feature on my Digi 003 audio interface also gave me a solid backup. &nbsp;The two keyboard I used as controllers both had synths inside, but I obviously preferred to use the nicer sounding and more flexible soft synths. &nbsp;The Aux in on the 003 lets me run my two keyboard audio outputs into the interface. &nbsp;If the computer were to crash or have software troubles, all I have to do is hit the hardware Aux In button and I&#39;m using the keyboard built in sounds and the performance can go on, albeit with not as nice sounding samples, but it&#39;s much better than silence!" />
