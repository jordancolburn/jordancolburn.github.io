<meta name="description" content="After years of trying different looping software such as Ableton Live and other open source alternatives, I still haven&#39;t found anything that provides a seamless instrument-like experience. Last year, I tried to program my own alternative, Recursion Looper: http://www.jordancolburn.com/diy-music-projects/recursion-looper It works ok, but the functionality was a little too complex and finicky for live performance. I always liked the simplicity and reliability of hardware looping, but only having one main song section available really limits song possibilities. So I&#39;ve again set out on programming my own solution. I like Ableton&#39;s Scenes and the ability to have different song sections, but I want the simplicity and immediate feel of the hardware pedal. I want to use combination of a pedal made out of a salvaged keyboard and the laptop keyboard to control the software. The functionality will be similar to having 4 separate loop pedals, with software logic to switch seamlessly between different sections and an overall mute control. After playing around some in Pure Data, I have a working demo of one section that provides looping, crossfading for smoother loops, overdubbing, 1 layer of undo (no redo), and 2 channel recording option (to allow only instrument looping while singing or vice versa). I&#39;m working on getting out some bugs and perfecting the individual loop. When I get around to combining and get to the real exciting part of combining the four loops and momentary and latching mute, I will post an update." />
