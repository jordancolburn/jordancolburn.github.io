<meta name="description" content="Those of you that use Ableton for looping know how nice it is to have a foot pedal to start and stop recording when your hands are full playing an instrument. The problem is, many MIDI pedals are expensive. So I developed a workaround solution that involves using Ableton&#39;s great keymap feature.

Some soldering and circuit experience is recommended/necessary for this project. Solder these leads onto momentary buttons in your own enclosure or a foot pedal that you have repurposed. Now onto how to actually utilize this new pedal. I typically use the Novation Launchpad, which with measure quantizing on recording start, works great to start recording a clip. However, stopping a clip requires me to stop playing, reach down and hit the exact right pad in time to keep the performance going.
