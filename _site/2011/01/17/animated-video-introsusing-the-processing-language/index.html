After playing with a few of the example sketches, I decided I really like the 3D image demonstration &quot;explode&quot;.&nbsp; It uses two for loops to go through every pixel in the image and plot them in 3D space.&nbsp; MouseX is multiplied by the brightness of each pixel so that when the mouseX is at it&#39;s minimum(mouse is all the way to the left),&nbsp; the image looks normal.&nbsp; But when mouseX is higher, the brighter pixels pop out and move toward the viewer. This was a very neat effect, but I wanted a little more control, so I used the &quot;camera&quot; command to map X and&nbsp;Z&nbsp;coordinants&nbsp;to mouseX and MouseY.&nbsp; This yields a unique effect where you can zoom in and rotate around the pixels that are in 3D space.&nbsp; The hardest part came when trying to set the presets in the camera command so that the logo used for the web intro would be displayed regular size and right side up when the mouse reaches the lower left hand corner. The final step was to include the commands to encode the output into a quicktime movie that I could import into iMovie. The following commands are what I used to combined my sketch and the MovieMaker example sketch. In setup():mm = new MovieMaker(this, width, height, &quot;drawing.mov&quot;); in draw() : mm.addFrame(); in a subroutine after draw() void keyPressed() { if (key == &#39; &#39;) { // Finish the movie if space bar is pressed mm.finish(); // Quit running the sketch once the file is written exit(); } }" />
