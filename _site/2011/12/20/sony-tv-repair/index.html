<meta name="description" content="While building things like the&nbsp;Beep It&nbsp;or a&nbsp;Plasma Speaker&nbsp;is fun, the result isn&#39;t always the most useful or practical. &nbsp;That&#39;s why it&#39;s always great to be able to put some of my EE skills to a use most people can appreciate. &nbsp; When my dad was offered a broken&nbsp;Sony Trinitron(Sony KV-30HS420), I was very excited to attempt a repair to revive an otherwise perfectly good HD TV. &nbsp;The guy giving the TV to my dad found an online guide that offered a possible way to fix the 6 or 7 blinking LED error code the TV was experiencing. http://k0lee.com/2011/05/fixing-a-sony-wega-with-6-or-7-blink-code/ The link comes from Lee Devlin, and his site reminded me a lot of my own, with a great collection of guides on a variety of technology. &nbsp;I&#39;m happy to report that his repair instructions were spot on, and the pictures in the guide proved very helpful. Ordering the chips needed for the repair went great. &nbsp;The online store was located in&nbsp;Evansville, Indiana and the order shipped quickly. After&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;the chips, it was a simple case of opening the TV, removing the board, unsoldering the chips, soldering in new sockets and replacing the chips. &nbsp;The whole process took about an hour and the hardest part was moving the 150 lb TV on and off of it&#39;s stand. If you run into a small error with some of your own gadgets, I encourage you to do some research online and put some simple repair skills to use. &nbsp;By finding guides like Lee&#39;s or some of the information I hope this site offers, it should be easy to keep your old electronics alive." />
