<p>A little more than a year or ago, I bought two channels of <a href="http://www.fivefishstudios.com/">FiveFish Studios&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;SC1 mk2 microphone preamp kit. &nbsp;One of my previous <a href="http://jordancolburn.com/2010/07/03/getting-started-with-a-diy-mic-preampsc1-mk2/">posts</a>&nbsp;show my initial progress and some pictures of the old RadioShack home theater amplifier I gutted to get the case to put this new project in. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I was still troubleshooting at that time and haven't had given an update since.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2011/12/IMG_1522.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-602" title="SC1_InRack" src="/uploads/2011/12/IMG_1522-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>I'm happy to report that after some simple troubleshooting, I was able to get the two channels running perfectly. &nbsp;After playing around with the grounding scheme some, I was able to get both channels operating at very high gain levels with no noise. &nbsp;Above you can see my mobile recording rack where the preamp has been since I completed it. I've used this preamp on just about every recording since finishing the kit and would recommend FiveFish products to anyone based on audio quality alone. &nbsp; It also helps that they have great support for a DIY kit and helped me troubleshoot the few issues I did run into. &nbsp;</p>
