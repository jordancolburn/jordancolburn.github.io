<p>So I'm always kicking around new ideas for loop based tools for solo electronic music performance. &nbsp;My latest idea involves a very simple interface, the Novation Launchpad tentatively called "Ultralight". &nbsp;I plan to incorporate audio looping, a step sequencer for electronic drums, a beat slicer for both the audio &nbsp;and drums, as well as a few simple synths and audio effects who's routing can be flexibly controlled using the launchpad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, most of my work has focused on understanding how to read and write from the launchpad (simple in a language like C, but harder in the graphical dataflow environment of PD). &nbsp;I've got an overall view with a few "modes" and have started to program some basic read/write light abstactions, as well as a few simple step sequencer and storage building blocks. &nbsp;Please see a few demos below if you're interested.</p>
