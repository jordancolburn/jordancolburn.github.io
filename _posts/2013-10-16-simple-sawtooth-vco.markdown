<p>For the first part of my modular synth exploration, I wanted a cheap and simple VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) that used only parts I had on hand. &nbsp;After some searching I found this design: <a href="http://electro-music.com/forum/topic-41483.html&amp;postorder=asc">http://electro-music.com/forum/topic-41483.html&amp;postorder=asc</a> It only uses two op amps and some other parts I had on hand. &nbsp;I threw it together on the breadboard pretty quick and it seems like a decent start towards my goal of making the cheapest and most simple modular synth I can. &nbsp;Listen to a demo below.</p>
