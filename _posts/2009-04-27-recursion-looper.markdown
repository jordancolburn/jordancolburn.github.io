<p>Recursion Looper is an application I programmed in Pure Data.&nbsp; There were many different tools for live looping in software and hardware forms, but nothing seemed to meet my needs.&nbsp; I combined the features that I used most into a piece of software to let me have a lot of flexibility and sound options in a very simple package. A quick demonstration video of Recursion in action:</p>

<p>Features include: -8 tracks(A and B section for each track) -Tempo synced -Adjustable time signatures -Midi Control (Designed for use with Oxygen-8 style 25 key controllers, can create and edit songs without touching the computer) -Flexible, on the fly recording -Simple, but powerful effects section note: you must have Pure Data installed to use this software Download Recursion looper from it's sourceforge page: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/recursionlooper/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/recursionlooper/</a></p>
