<p>The very awesome grid controller you see me playing with here is the Novation Launchpad. &nbsp;I've been eyeing a Novation Launchpad ever since they came out. &nbsp;My relationship with Ableton Live as a live looping tool has always been very love/hate. &nbsp;Sometimes I wish for the simplicity of a loop pedal and was seriously considering the Vox VL-1 due to come out sometime in april. &nbsp;However, finding a used launchpad at less than half the price inspired me to give Ableton one last shot. &nbsp;I'm proud to say that I'm very happy with my decision so far.</p>
<p>Looping with Ableton requires more time setting up the sound and for me so far is a little less&nbsp;improvisational&nbsp;in that I have to put more thought into what is coming next and plan. &nbsp;The only prerecorded sounds in the video above were the drum loops. &nbsp;I've experimented on and off with using a click and generating everything live, but the most natural way i've found so far is to just record everything on top of preexisting drum loops. &nbsp;The only other feature I wish I had was a way to assign a keyboard key or midi note on a foot control to a genric "stop recording and play loop" button for any tracks currently recording. &nbsp;This would allow me to keep my hands on the instrument and play pickups into the start of the loop.</p>
