Blame it on the hipsters or on the availability of great cameras for cheap, but film photography is making a comeback. I've been shooting film on and off for a few years now, but lately I've been only bringing film cameras on my vacations for photos. The cheaper cameras, lack of immediate photo review on an LCD screen make for a much more enjoyable trip, while still getting great photos! I'd like to share a few tips if you're considering

1. Get a camera that doesn't need batteries
The beauty of all mechanical cameras is that you don't need to worry about charging batteries the night before, or missing a shot. Just throw the camera and film in the bag. I also don't use the meter on the rangefinder I have (it needs some work), so I just use the Sunny 16 rule to estimate exposure. Film doesn't have immediate feedback, so this forces you to think more carefully about your shots, and be more conservative, allowing you to take in the moment better, rather than firing off 25 shots of a cool building and hoping one turns out.

2. Shoot Color and Black and White
Black and white is much easier to develop at home, so you can send the color stuff to a lab and immediatly develop and scan your own black and white. Black and white also provides a unique look and in my opinion, puts some modern scenes in an interesting context.

3. Plan your film
Think about when/what you will be doing and choose appropriate color/ISO options. I typically bring one roll of B/W ISO 400 (like a Kodak Tri-x) and one color ISO 100 (like  Kodak Ektar) for a weekend trip and double that for a longer trip. Always toss in an extra just to be safe.

4. Consider taking two cameras
I like to pair a super small rangefinder (Ricoh 500g) with a larger DSLR (Pentax K1000). This way, one camera can have color film, and the other can have black and white. My wife and I both like to take photos, so this gives us each a camera nearby, or we can leave the larger camera in the hotel room for quicker day trips and still get great photos from the rangefinder.

5. Just Do It
If you're like most photographers these days, you will feel like you're missing out by not bringing your expensive and bulky dslr, along with 10 different lenses. However, just try travelling with a film camera, one prime lens and gurantee you will have a lot of fun
