<p>Changing servers for what will hopefully be the last time for a while. I'm migrating away from a home hosted server using Turnkey Linux because our internet service is a little bit spotty at the moment.</p>
<p>This new server will provide more uptime and a more permanent home for this site. There will be a few glitches with some missing media and theme issues and posts while I switch servers and update things, but it should be sorted out in a few days. Thanks for reading.</p>
