<p>If you ever wanted to use your electric guitar&nbsp;to jam along with a group of friends playing acoustic outside, then this is the project for you.</p>

<p>It's easy to make, and only takes about an hour.&nbsp; I made my circuit based on the following instructions, but modified some component values based on what I had on hand. <a title="http://makezine.com/projects/make-09/the-5-cracker-box-amp/" href="http://makezine.com/projects/make-09/the-5-cracker-box-amp/" target="_blank">http://makezine.com/projects/make-09/the-5-cracker-box-amp/</a> It sounds great and with the gain all the way up, is surprisingly very loud.&nbsp; The sound is very distorted, both leads and powerchords blend well with acoustic guitar.&nbsp; Dialing the gain back provides a usable tone, but tends to&nbsp;sound a little bit&nbsp;lo-fi and cheap (well, it does only cost around $10) &nbsp;in a bad way. It's a great project to get started in electronics, and is actually practical.</p>
