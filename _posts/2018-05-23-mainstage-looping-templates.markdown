<p>Since my video tutorial series on live looping using mainstage got a lot of interest and follow up questions (<a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc0XEouT8ZM" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc0XEouT8ZM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc0XEouT8ZM</a>), I decided to offer a custom mainstage consulting option.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>For $100 I will make a custom template for your live looping performance style</strong></h3>
<p>Just let me know what instruments you are looking to perform with (guitar, midi keys, analog keys, vocals, etc.) and what audio interface/midi controllers you have and I will build you a custom Mainstage Template with all the routing, buttons, instruments and effects that you need</p>
<p>You can use the button below to place an order and add the details of what kind of template you want and I will contact you shortly with some follow up questions. Please email me at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>jordancolburn@gmail.com</strong></span> with any questions or more detailed comments you may have.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%;">I can only create within the context of what Mainstage allows. If you need some custom logic that Mainstage is not capable of, I will try to help find you a workaround. If you are not completely satisfied with your final template, I offer a 100% refund guarantee</p>
