<p>I've been wanting more experience making analog effects for my guitars and keyboards. &nbsp;I did a lot of searching on the net for things I can make with common components I was likely to have on hand and found this very easy DIY project.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Simple Fuzz Pedal&nbsp;</span></strong>I found a simple circuit using an LM386n power amp chip and some diodes to make a fuzz effect.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-overdrive-effect-pedal/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-overdrive-effect-pedal/</a> The recording below was made using a squier telecaster, and the fuzz pedal run through a clean keyboard amp. &nbsp;It was recorded with a shure sm57 and no other effects were added.</p>

<p>I modified some of the capacitor values based on what I had available, I went with a .01uF ceramic (instead of .1) and 100uF electrolytic (instead of a 220). &nbsp;The results was a little&nbsp;disappointing&nbsp;at first, more of an annoying background buzz than a fuzz or overdrive. &nbsp;I played with the supply voltage and realized that lower supply voltage resulted in the fuzz kicking in at lower volume levels, I found the optimal supply voltage to the chip was just below 5V. &nbsp;If you're setting up to use this with a 9V battery, you can use a voltage regulator or potentiometer to allow you to change the voltage to tailor the sound of the effect.</p>
