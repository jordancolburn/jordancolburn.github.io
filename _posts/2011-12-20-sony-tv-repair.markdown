<p>While building things like the&nbsp;<a title="Beep It" href="http://jordancolburn.com/2009/04/27/beep-it/" target="_blank">Beep It</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a title="Plasma Speaker" href="http://jordancolburn.com/2011/05/17/plasma-speaker/" target="_blank">Plasma Speaker</a>&nbsp;is fun, the result isn't always the most useful or practical. &nbsp;That's why it's always great to be able to put some of my EE skills to a use most people can appreciate. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When my dad was offered a broken&nbsp;<a title="Sony Trinitron" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-KV-30HS420-Trinitron-HD-Ready-Widescreen/dp/B0002F7I9O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1310389853&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">Sony Trinitron(Sony KV-30HS420)</a>, I was very excited to attempt a repair to revive an otherwise perfectly good HD TV. &nbsp;The guy giving the TV to my dad found an online guide that offered a possible way to fix the 6 or 7 blinking LED error code the TV was experiencing. <a href="http://k0lee.com/2011/05/fixing-a-sony-wega-with-6-or-7-blink-code/">http://k0lee.com/2011/05/fixing-a-sony-wega-with-6-or-7-blink-code/</a> The link comes from Lee Devlin, and his site reminded me a lot of my own, with a great collection of guides on a variety of technology. &nbsp;I'm happy to report that his repair instructions were spot on, and the pictures in the guide proved very helpful. Ordering the chips needed for the repair went great. &nbsp;The online store was located in&nbsp;Evansville, Indiana and the order shipped quickly.</p>
<p>After&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;the chips, it was a simple case of opening the TV, removing the board, unsoldering the chips, soldering in new sockets and replacing the chips. &nbsp;The whole process took about an hour and the hardest part was moving the 150 lb TV on and off of it's stand. If you run into a small error with some of your own gadgets, I encourage you to do some research online and put some simple repair skills to use. &nbsp;By finding guides like Lee's or some of the information I hope this site offers, it should be easy to keep your old electronics alive.</p>
