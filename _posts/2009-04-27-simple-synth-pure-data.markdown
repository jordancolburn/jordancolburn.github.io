<p>This is one of the first pd projects I completed, it's a simple synthesizer with three unique oscillators and one modulation for each oscilator, and overall filter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control for the 8 parameters can be accesed using an 8 knob style&nbsp;midi controller such as the MidAir 25 or Oxygen 8.</p>
<p>Simple Synth&nbsp;was mainly an experiment to try out using GriPD for user interfaces, to use this patch you must have PD and GriPD installed, you can get GriPD from: <a href="http://crca.ucsd.edu/%7Ejsarlo/gripd/">http://crca.ucsd.edu/~jsarlo/gripd/</a> To download the Latest version, <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/jordancolburn/diy-music-projects/simple-synth/simplesynth.zip">Click Here</a></p>
