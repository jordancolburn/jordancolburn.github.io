<p>I was wanting to work on a more elaborate project that would actually result in some gear that I really needed in my studio. &nbsp;My studio setup was nice but was lacking a high quality preamp. &nbsp;After some research I decided on getting a fivefish SC1-mk2 preamp kit. &nbsp;I'd heard great reviews on it's quality and got two channels to be my main clean "go-to" preamp. I decided to&nbsp;resurrect an old Radioshack brand&nbsp;stereo reciever case into my new preamp. &nbsp;It was a nice 2U space rack and also had 2 big analog VU meters. Currently I've finished one channel and am troubleshooting some issues with broken DPDT switches that were built into the old Radioshack case.</p>
