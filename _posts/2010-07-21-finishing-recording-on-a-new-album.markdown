<p>It's been four years since I last released an album. I been recording constantly since then, but have had a hard time trying to group together a series of finished tracks for a new album. I make a wide variety of songs, from very electronic, rock, acoustic and solo piano. The different styles don't always flow well together. I finally decide that to get it together and finish something, I will focus my next album on the electronic side of my music and save the more acoustic tracks for another day. I currently have about 8 songs tracked and still have some mixing to do and a few more songs to write. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
